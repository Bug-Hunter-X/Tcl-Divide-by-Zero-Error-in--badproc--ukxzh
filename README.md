This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure (`badproc`) that demonstrates a potential divide-by-zero error.  The `bug.tcl` file shows the erroneous code, which can cause a runtime error if the first argument is 0. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version of the procedure that handles this case gracefully.
